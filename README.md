🏎️ Formula 1 Performance Analytics (1950–2024)

An end-to-end data analytics project exploring 70+ years of Formula 1 World Championship data (1950–2024).

This project combines my personal interest in the Formula 1 World Championship with applied data analytics techniques to uncover performance trends, dominance eras, and historical insights.

📌 Project Objective

To analyze long-term driver performance and championship evolution by:

Cleaning and structuring multi-table relational data

Calculating performance metrics (wins, podiums, averages)

Identifying dominance cycles

Visualizing historical performance trends

Building an interactive driver performance query tool

📊 Dataset

The dataset contains historical race-level and driver-level data from 1950 to 2024, including:

Race results

Drivers

Constructors

Circuits

Seasonal data

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Google Colab

🔍 Key Analyses Performed
1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Converted data types

Removed invalid/missing values

Structured relational datasets

2️⃣ Driver Performance Metrics

Total wins per driver

Total podium finishes

Win percentage

Average finishing position

3️⃣ Dominance vs Consistency Analysis

Comparison of wins and podium finishes to differentiate dominance from consistent performance.

4️⃣ Time Series Analysis

Visualization of wins over time to highlight structural growth and seasonal expansion.

5️⃣ Heatmap – Wins by Year

Heatmap showing peak dominance eras of top drivers such as:

Lewis Hamilton

Michael Schumacher

Max Verstappen

6️⃣ Interactive Driver Query

A dynamic function allowing users to input a driver's name and retrieve:

Total races

Wins

Podiums

Average finish

Win percentage

Personal win trend visualization

📈 Key Insights

Dominance in Formula 1 tends to occur in concentrated eras rather than being evenly distributed.

Modern seasons feature significantly more races than early decades.

Total wins alone do not reflect consistency — podium frequency provides deeper insight.

Competitive cycles are visible through temporal visualization.
